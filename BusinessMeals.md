    Please use "External Party Business Meal" to submit business meal expenses through Travel & Expense.

All meals would be covered by Travel Allowance unless it is business meal as stated below or meal with IBMer.

Business Meal with External Party is defined as employee having a face-to-face, sit down in restaurant, business meal with customers. For business discussion reasons, having coffee or tea together with customer is considered as business meal. Buying of foodstuff or liquor or other gifts to be given to customer, or sponsorship of customer annual dinner is not considered as a business meal. For example, below expense is not in the scope of business meal:

    Expense of Foodstuffs purchase which included drinks, wine, biscuit, fruit and cake etc. from department store, supermarkets etc. cannot be reimbursable as business meal.
    Expense for shopping card or coupons to client are not allowed to be claimed as business meal.

## Regulation

Here is the regulation for Business Meals Claim:

1. For all business meal with customers (include GOE and non GOE) excess of RMB250 per head per meal but below CTEBA clip level, employee should get CN CFO's pre-approval.

*Employee should plan well and do not allow such situation in the first place and get pre-approval via email (before meal happens) from CFO for any meal estimated beyond RMB250 per head per meal but below CTEBA clip level, no matter where it takes place.

The purpose of the RMB250 clip level for GCG for business meals is to set a level for which the risk of FCPA and other legal violations is considered acceptable to IBM China and to provide Finance the opportunity to monitor higher value meals that IBM provides to our customers. The actions of each and every IBMer can bind the company and the clip levels are not meant to be circumvented by IBMers volunteering to pay for meals personally and not claim them through the Travel & Expense system. Accordingly, all meals that are purchased for customers by IBMers (whether paid for by IBM or not) must receive Finance approval if the per person per meal cost exceeds RMB250.

2. The following details are required to be attached/indicated in report:

    Date of the meal if such information is not apparent from the merchant's receipt.
    Merchant name is mandatory field to input. Merchant name which you input in the merchant field of Travel & Expense should be consistent with the name shown on the official invoice attached in the expense report. Full name in English or Chinese or Pinyin must be input in the merchant field.
    Attendees' name (including any IBMers), customer's title and company name.
    Specific business reason for the meal.

3. For external party business meals and/or entertainment which involve IBMers, the most senior level IBM employee in attendance of the hosting/funding team is responsible to pay for and submit the meal expense for reimbursement.
